VIET_ceres_hanging;Hanging for Ceres;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_ceres_hanging_desc;Recently, a known farmer in this province attempted to use magical charms to curse the crops of his neighbor. Such an affront to the various deities, Ceres among them, meant that he had to be executed by hanging in the name of Ceres. Nevertheless, the fact that there are locals using dark magics, offending gods and mortals alike, is of great concern. There will be unrest for some time as the people living here are growing suspicious of one another.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_glaucus_herb;Glaucus Herb;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_glaucus_herb_desc;Some superstitious locals believe they have discovered the herb known as 'dog's tooth' in various parts of this province. According to legend, this was the same herb that the fisherman Glaucus ate to become immortal.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_glaucus_herb_good;Tried the Herb of Glaucus;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_glaucus_herb_good_desc;This character was foolish enough to try an herb that superstitious peasants thought to be the same 'dog's tooth' that gave the legendary fisherman Glaucus immortality. Fortunately, it seems that the herb did have some beneficial effects.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_glaucus_herb_bad;Tried the Herb of Glaucus;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_glaucus_herb_bad_desc;This character was foolish enough to try an herb that superstitious peasants thought to be the same 'dog's tooth' that gave the legendary fisherman Glaucus immortality. Unfortunately, it seems that the herb had some negative effects.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_flora_statue;Statue of Flora;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_flora_statue_desc;This character recently bought a statue of the goddess Flora to decorate their residence. It is quite beautiful! The craftsmanship looks excellent. Such a statue is surely a blessing.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_flora_statue_lustful;Statue of Flora (for Nefarious Purposes);;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_flora_statue_lustful_desc;This character recently bought a statue of the goddess Flora to decorate their residence. It is quite beautiful! The craftsmanship looks excellent. It seems this character, however, had baser, debauched reasons for purchasing such a statue of a nude young woman.;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.530.desc;The greatest of the ancient Hellenic city states were Athens and Sparta, yet in comparing and contrasting them, one can easily see how they were very different. Today, you've come across two courtiers arguing about which one was better. Seeing you nearby, they ask for your input. Was it the mighty, warrior Spartans who were better? Or the crafty, philosophy-loving Athenians?;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.530.a;Athens of course! An admirable, cultured people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.530.b;Sparta, no doubt. Their armies were to be feared!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.530.c;They were both flawed and pathetic, for they had great hubris.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.530.d;Actually I have to go with Thebes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.531.desc;There are a number of deities who are not popularly worshipped, but most of them are minor compared to the mightiest of the gods. Yet some are quite powerful. For instance you have been thinking about Nox, the goddess who is Night itself, is feared even by Jupiter. Perhaps it might do to show this underappreciated deity some devotion.;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.531.a;Some prayers will do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.531.b;I’ll dedicate a statue and praise her with ancient poetry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.531.c;I'm just being superstitious. Enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_nyx_poetry_praise;\n\nO Nox!\nEver shall this house throughout the circling periods of the year hold thee high in honour and in worship.\nBlack bulls of chosen beauty shall pay thee sacrifice.\nO goddess!\nVulcanus’ fire shall eat the lustral entrails, where-o'er the new milk streams.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.532.desc;Today you felt an unusual amount of lust, so alarming that you had to consult with the diviners as surely this was not a natural occurrence. They concluded that one of the so-called Erotes, lesser gods who were Venus’ sons and attendants, must have pranked you for some reason. You were given some spells to recite. Hopefully, they will repel the Erotes and their mischief.;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.532.a;Let these spells work!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.532.b;On the other hand, I like feeling lustful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.532.c;Wait, couldn't I just appeal to Venus herself?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.533.tooltip;Surely she will be able to help me. I will pray to her and make offerings.;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.533.desc;Later that night, in your dreams, Venus appears before you. She is graceful, elegant, and beautiful beyond compare even as she apologizes to you about the Erotes. “Those sons of mine should not have been such a nuisance to you,” she says. “After all, I have no quarrel with you. Yet. Now, take this small token as appreciation for your wisdom in praying to me for help. You clearly know who is in charge.”\n\nWhen you wake up, you feel normal again, yet strangely, more confident and blessed. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.533.a;What a mysterious dream!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.534.desc;You attend a minor religious ceremony when the priest performing the public prayer accidentally forgot to mention a couple of the prayer's beneficiaries. Professionals usually don't make such mistakes, but per Roman custom and belief, this cannot be ignored. Though it is almost done, the entire ritual must be redone if it is to be effective. Are you willing to sit through all that again?;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.534.a;We all make mistakes - restart the ritual.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.534.b;If the priest messes up again I'll punish them!;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.534.c;I don't want to sit through this again.;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.534.d;Does it matter? It's just words.;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.535.desc;A local town nearby has unveiled a new statue of Epona, the goddess of horses, donkeys, and fertility. Once a Gallic deity, she was adopted by the Romans as their own and is fast gaining popularity again.;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.535.a;May she protect the locals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.536.desc;Your courtier recently broke a oath they made not too long ago. It was a minor oath, of little importance, and yet some in your court cannot help but point out that this courtier will have to answer to Orcus, the god of the Underworld who punishes oath breakers.;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.536.a;At least it wasn't me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.536.b;I should remember not to break oaths myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.536.c;Silly nonsense. Orcus won’t come down to punish a random mortal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.537.desc;Some say the god of the forge, Vulcan, truly was hideous and ugly. Others say he was actually quite good looking, but only by mortal standards, and thus was ‘ugly’ for a deity. Yet others say through the centuries, confused and foolish people misunderstood the ancients myths, and he is as handsome as any other god.;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.537.a;He is probably ugly, but an Olympian nevertheless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.537.b;He is probably good looking for a mortal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.537.c;Who could think of an Olympian being ugly?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.538.desc;A farmer living nearby has been accused of using various magical charms to reduce his neighbor's crops and increase his own. This is an affront to Ceres, goddess of agriculture, and by ancient custom is to be punishable by death. The accused claims this was all a misunderstanding and that he was merely doing some protective but not harmful charms for his own crops, but further investigation reveals that he is guilty and will be hung for Ceres.;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.538.a;Such are the ancient laws.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.539.desc;One of your courtiers has recently purchased a statue of Flora for their garden. As goddess of flowers, her presence is welcoming in a garden. You and several others pay a visit to your courtier and find the statue most agreeable - it almost seems alive, like as if the statue will start moving at any moment. Your courtier says they can refer you to the sculptor, who charges a decent price.;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.539.a;A fine addition to my collection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.539.b;I shall use the statue as a private altar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.539.c;The statue is almost like a real girl! Mine will fuel my imagination....;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.539.d;On second thought, I am not willing to pay that much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.540.desc;One day you are talking with a traveling merchant who has recently come back from a long trip to faraway lands. This merchant said how in other realms, foreigners mock some of our gods as being frivolous. In particular, the merchant remembers an encounter with a particularly rude man who could not understand the concept of Sterquilinus, our god of feces and sewage.;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.540.a;How ignorant. Even a god of such things is a god!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.540.b;It sounds silly, but every deity has their purpose, as we all do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.540.c;Manure is an important aspect of agriculture!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.541.desc;While traveling in the countryside nearby you come across a beautiful, wild fruit tree, full of fresh, ripe fruit. You pick a few of the apples and eat them, and find them most pleasing to your palate. Surely, to come across such a thing today is no coincidence! Perhaps this is a good sign from the goddess Pomona, whose domain is the flowering of fruit trees.;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.541.a;Maybe, maybe not. Delicious, nevertheless!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.541.b;I should thank her with offerings when I get home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.542.desc;A brief storm recently caused much anxiety. A bolt of lightning struck the statue of Jupiter atop a local temple, and its head was nowhere to be seen afterwards. Diviners however determined it was hurled into a nearby river at so and so spot. Sure enough, it was found right there, and restored to the temple. Some say Jupiter wishes to remind us of our duties and place in life.;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.542.a;I believe that as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.542.b;We must be virtuous with or without such reminders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.542.c;Who cares?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.543.desc;An herb was recently discovered in your realm that is said to be the ‘dog’s tooth,’ which is the same kind of herb that gave the legendary fisherman Glaucus his immortality and turned him into the prophetic sea-god he is today. That notion was easily dispelled, when a local criminal who ate the herb was summarily executed for his crime, but there are those who still fervently believe that even if it doesn’t give immortality, that the herb has many beneficial effects.;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.543.a;What fools they are!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.543.b;Perhaps I could try some myself? Just in case.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_glaucus_herb_good_text;The herb has a positive effect on you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_glaucus_herb_bad_text;The herb has a negative effect on you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.544.desc;Last night I dreamt a beautiful woman dressed in armor visited me, and we had the most insightful discussions on many different topics. She even showed me some valuable scrolls filled with ancient wisdom. Before the dream ended, she said she was in fact the goddess Minerva, and that she found it pertinent to her interests that I learned a few things from her.;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.544.a;That was quite a dream! I feel smarter already.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.545.desc;Dignitaries from a local town visited me today, bearing gifts of pomegranates in Pluto and Prosperina’s honor. They said that many generations ago, in the days of the old Roman Empire, they were constantly under threat by a powerful band of bandits. They prayed to all the gods, but only Pluto and Prosperina came to their aid, for some reason. Thus they honor them even now.;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellenic.545.a;An interesting tale! And thank you for the pomegranates.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
